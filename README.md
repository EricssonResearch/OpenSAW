OpenSAW
=====
OpenSAW stands for Open Security Analysis Workbench, and is a framework for building systems that use
concolic execution to find bugs in compiled programs.
 OpenSAWs main feature is that it allows users to quickly start developing and testing their own bug-finding search strategies. 
 OpenSAW is written in Python and allows the concolic execution engine to be replaced easily, letting users
 test how well their own concolic execution implementation performs in comparison with others.
### Setup
See [```docs/SETUP.md```](docs/SETUP.md)

### Usage
##### WARNING: Do not run OpenSAW on malicious code. The executable you provide is executed with the same permissions as OpenSAW.
Running OpenSAW on a binary is trivial in the OpenSAW virtual machine.   
After you are connected to the machine, run the command
```sh
python2.7 -m opensaw -i <initial_input> -- <executable> [arguments, {} is replaced by input filename]
```
to launch OpenSAW on <executable> that takes a single file as input argument.
OpenSAW will start with passing the file defined by <initial_input> to the program
and then proceed to generate new inputs based on the trace created by this execution.

See [```docs/Using OpenSAW.md```](docs/Using OpenSAW.md) for more details and information on how to track progress.

### Building your own search strategy
One of the great features with OpenSAW is that it lets users quickly get their hands dirty and experiment with new 
bug-finding search strategies. 
This is done by extending an existing search strategy or writing a new one.
Descriptions of existing search strategies and also instructions on how to write your own
can be found in  [```docs/Strategies.md```](docs/Strategies.md)
